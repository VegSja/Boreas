# dg api issue Reference

Commands for interacting with Dagster Plus Issues.

A Dagster Plus Issue is a record of a problem within the Users' Dagster deployment like you would find in an issue tracking tool. Issues have the following fields: ID, title, description, status, createdBy, links to related Runs and Assets, and additional context about the Issue, including any previous conversations about the problem.

Some organizations do not have access to Dagster Plus Issues. If you get an Unauthorized error indicating that Issues are not available, inform the user that Issues are not enabled for their organization.

## Get a specific Dagster Plus Issue

```bash
dg api issue get <ID>
```
- `<ID>` — the ID of the Issue to get

## List Issues for a deployment.

```bash
dg api issue list
```
Issues can be filtered by:
- Status: `--status` - options are `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, `TRIAGE`. Multiple `--status` filters can be specified
- Created before: `--created-before` - filter to Issues created before this date
- Created after: `--created-after` - filter to Issues created after this date

The response will contain a list of `limit` Issues in chronologically descending order. To fetch the next page of Issues, use the ID of the oldest Issue as the cursor.

## Create a Dagster Plus Issue

```bash
dg api issue create --title <title> --description <description> --status <status>
